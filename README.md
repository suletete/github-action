# 📘 GitHub Actions and CI/CD Course Project - YAML

## 🚀 Course Overview

Welcome to this engaging and practical course on **GitHub Actions** and **Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)**. This course will equip you with the skills to automate your development workflow, boost code quality, and speed up deployments using GitHub Actions.

Whether you're a beginner or a seasoned developer, you’ll gain hands-on knowledge that transforms how you manage your software projects.

## 🎼 Why This Course Matters

**Analogy: Instructor Orchestra**

Imagine being a conductor of an orchestra. Each developer is a musician with their instrument (code), and together they create a harmonious symphony (software). **GitHub Actions** and **CI/CD** are your conductor’s baton, orchestrating code changes, tests, and deployments so everything flows smoothly—on time and in sync.

## 🛠 YAML Syntax for Workflows

YAML is a human-readable language used to configure workflows.

### 🔑 Key Concepts:
- Indentation (spaces, not tabs)
- Key-value pairs
- Lists (using `-`)

### 🧾 Example Workflow Snippet:
```yaml
name: Example Workflow
on: [push]
```

---

## 🧱 Workflow Structure and Components

| Component | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Workflow File** | Located in `.github/workflows/` (e.g., `main.yml`) |
| **Jobs** | Define groups of steps (e.g., build, test, deploy) |
| **Steps** | Specific tasks (e.g., `npm install`) |
| **Actions** | Reusable commands (e.g., `actions/checkout@v2`) |
| **Events** | Triggers for the workflow (e.g., `push`, `pull_request`) |
| **Runners** | Environment that executes jobs (e.g., `ubuntu-latest`) |

## 🧪 Module 3: Implementing Continuous Integration

### 🔧 Lesson 1: Building and Testing Code

#### 🎯 Objectives:
- Set up build steps.
- Run automated tests as part of CI.

### 🧱 Define Build Job:
```yaml
jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
```

### 🛠 Add Build Steps:
```yaml
steps:
- uses: actions/checkout@v2

- name: Install dependencies
  run: npm install

- name: Build
  run: npm run build
```

### 🧪 Run Tests:
```yaml
- name: Run tests
  run: npm test
```

---

## 💡 Learner Notes:
- `runs-on: ubuntu-latest` → Executes on GitHub-hosted Ubuntu VM.
- `actions/checkout@v2` → Pulls code from your repository.
- `npm install` → Installs project dependencies.
- `npm run build` → Builds the project.
- `npm test` → Runs automated tests.

---

## 🧩 Additional YAML Concepts in GitHub Actions

### 🌍 Using Environment Variables:
```yaml
env:
  CUSTOM_VAR: value

jobs:
  example:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Use environment variable
        run: echo $CUSTOM_VAR
```

---

### 🔐 Working with Secrets:
```yaml
jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Use secret
        run: |
          echo "Access Token: ${{ secrets.ACCESS_TOKEN }}"
```

---

### ⚙️ Conditional Execution:
```yaml
jobs:
  conditional-job:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    if: github.event_name == 'push' && github.ref == 'refs/heads/main'
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
```

---

### 🔄 Outputs and Inputs Between Steps:
```yaml
jobs:
  example:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - id: step-one
        run: echo "::set-output name=value::$(echo hello)"

      - id: step-two
        run: |
          echo "Received value: ${{ steps.step-one.outputs.value }}"
```

---

## 🔑 Learner Insights:
- **Environment Variables**: Great for project-wide config.
- **Secrets**: Securely store sensitive data like API keys.
- **Conditionals**: Make workflows smarter and more efficient.
- **Outputs**: Pass data between steps for advanced logic.

---

## 🧪 Lesson 2: Configuring Build Matrices

### 🎯 Objectives:
- Implement parallel and matrix builds.
- Manage testing across multiple environments.

⚙️ *This lesson continues into setting up complex CI scenarios like building for multiple Node.js versions or OS combinations. You can specify matrices to parallelize your CI across versions/platforms.*
